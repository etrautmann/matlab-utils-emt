% symRegress
%
% This function does least squares regression between a matrix dX and X.
% It finds a matrix M such that dX = XM (as close as possible in the 
% least squares sense).  Unlike regular least squares regression (M = X\dX)
% this function find M such that M is a symmetric matrix, that is, 
% M = M^T.
%
% Put another way, this is least squares regression over the constrained set
% of symmetric matrices.  
%
% NOTE: Compare to skewSymRegress()
%
% This can be solved by treating M as a vector of the unique elements that
% exist in a symmetric matrix. A symmetric matrix M of size n by n really only
% has n*(n+1)/2 unique entries.  That is, the diagonal and the
% upper/lower triangle is the transpose of the lower/upper.  So,
% we can just think of such a matrix as a vector x of size n(n+1)/2.
%
% Corresponding to this change in M, we would have to change X to be quite
% big and quite redundant.  That can be done, but an easier and 
% faster and more stable thing to do is to use an iterative solver
% that takes a function and gradient evaluation. 
% This iterative procedure is numerically accurate, etc, etc.
% So, this allows us to never make a big X matrix, and we just have to
% reshape M between vector and symmetric matrix form as appropriate.

    % initialize m0 somehow. It does not matter, as this function is
    % convex... ie there is provable one unique minimizer.  But a good
    % initialization will help the optimization converge faster in theory
    % (though in practice this is so fast anyway that it is unnoticed).
    M0 = X\dX; % the non-symmetric matrix.
    M0k = 0.5*(M0 + M0'); % the symmetric matrix component...
